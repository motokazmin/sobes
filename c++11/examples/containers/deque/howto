template<
    class T,
    class Allocator = std::allocator<T>
> class deque;

T must meet the requirements of CopyAssignable and CopyConstructible.

A deque is generally implemented as a collection of memory blocks. 



    Random access - constant O(1)
    Insertion or removal of elements at the end or beginning - constant O(1)
    Insertion or removal of elements - linear O(n)
