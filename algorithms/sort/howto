Stable sort: A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input data set


Selection, Bubble, Merge, Quick

Selection: O(N*N), memory O(1), not stable - find next min element, swap with current
Bubble:    O(N*N), memory O(1), stable     - swap the adjacent elements
Merge:     O(N*ln(N)), memory O(N), stable - reqursively split until every part will contain only one element
Quick:    not stable
	Worth case   - O(N*N) - every time pick min/max element as pivot point
	Best  case   - O(N*Ln(N)) every time pick median element by value
	Average case - O(N*Ln(N))
